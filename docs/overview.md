Fantasy Premier League (FPL) has announced the introduction of a new chip, which will be available for use starting 1st February 2025.

The objective of this project is to build a data-driven tool that helps FPL managers determine the right time to activate the chip and select the best manager(s) to maximise points over three consecutive gameweeks.

The tool will provide insights, visualisations, and strategic recommendations to support informed decision-making throughout the season.
