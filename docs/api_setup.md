# API Setup

This section explains how to connect to the Sportmonks API:

- Register for an API token at [Sportmonks](https://sportmonks.com).
- Use the API token to authenticate your requests.

I chose Sportsmonks as my data source because the project requires live data from Premier League. 
I also want regular data updates to be automated so I'm using APIs as opposed to data scraping.
