# Problems and Solutions: Visualising Football Stats

## Overview - 18.01.25
I am aiming to visualise the statistics generated from the [**table**](images/awaydataclean.png) produced via the [**away script**](new_folder/awaydatascript.png). The process involves using several Python packages, which must be compatible with the `numpy` library. 

## Challenges
One major challenge encountered was dependency conflicts between `numpy` and other required packages, which resulted in [**errors**](images/numpy_error.png) during installation and execution:

## Solution
To resolve this issue, I opted to use a [**virtual environment**](images/venv.png). This approach isolates the project dependencies, ensuring compatibility and preventing conflicts. The virtual environment has been successfully implemented to run the [dash script](images/dash.png) & create a [graph](images/dash_table_rough.png):

## Next Step
Improving on my 1st draft & producing a better graph(s)
