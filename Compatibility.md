# Problems and Solutions: Visualising Football Stats

## Overview
This project visualises football statistics generated from the [table](images/awaydataclean.png) produced via the **away script** ([insert link here]). The process involves using several Python packages, which must be compatible with the `numpy` library. 

## Challenges
One major challenge encountered was dependency conflicts between `numpy` and other required packages, which resulted in errors during installation and execution:

## Solution
To resolve this issue, I opted to use a **virtual environment**. This approach isolates the project dependencies, ensuring compatibility and preventing conflicts. The virtual environment has been successfully implemented to run the scripts:

## Conclusion
By addressing the compatibility issues through the use of a virtual environment, the project now runs smoothly without dependency errors.
